# MOS-Tron Envelope Filter

Based on the Chewborg Envelope Filter by Dylan159 at <a href="https://www.freestompboxes.org/viewtopic.php?p=295935&sid=e7d8aaea46729323c06e2183b44c25a7#p295935">freestomboxes.org</a>, thank you Dylan!

According to Dylan159, the Chewborg is designed around the familiar sounds of the most popular envelope filters of all time, but instead of being designed with LDRs, Vactrols, or JFETs, his design is based around using the CD4007’s matched CMOS FETs to form the state-variable filter. This project takes Dylan159’s clever design work and packages it up into a 125B.

## Before you get started...

**No direct support is offered for issues faced when building this project.** This project works as designed, but this project is not for first-time builders. There are plenty of projects that are better suited for beginners, it's probably best not to choose this project if you're still getting a grasp for pedal building.

This project uses stacked circuit boards in a 125B enclosure with top I/O jacks. Some special parts are required, including low-profile electrolytic capacitors, special fasteners, and inline pin headers/sockets. Special care must be taken when handling the CD4007 IC as well because these ICs are notoriously sensitive to static electricity.

## Included Files
- **PCB Gerber Files** - packaged and ready to submit to your preferred PCB manufacturer.
  - Top Board Gerber Files - zipped archive of Gerber files for the top PCB.
  - Bottom Board Gerber Files - zipped archive of Gerber files for the bottom PCB.
- **PDF Build Document** - includes all of the following:
  - Bill of Materials (BOM)
  - 125B Drill Template
  - Schematic
  - and project notes...
 
*This project requires two circuit boards, each of them must be ordered to complete this project.

## Tayda Drill Tool Template...

Here's a template for this project's enclosure using Tayda Electronics' Drill Tool utility:

## Build Pictures

Here are some pics of our personal build of this project:

*The Bypass I/O that you see in the build pictures is not related to this project and is not included in the Gerber files. You may (or may not) notice that the enclosure pictured has an extra hole in the middle of the lower control set. That's because the wrong drill tool template was chosen at the time that this enclosure was ordered. The Tayda Drill Tool template linked above is the correct template.
