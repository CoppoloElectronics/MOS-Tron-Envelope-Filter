# MOS-Tron Envelope Filter

Based on the Chewborg Envelope Filter by Dylan159 at <a href="https://www.freestompboxes.org/viewtopic.php?p=295935&sid=e7d8aaea46729323c06e2183b44c25a7#p295935">freestomboxes.org</a>, thank you Dylan!

According to Dylan159, the Chewborg is designed around the familiar sounds of the most popular envelope filters of all time, but instead of being designed with LDRs, Vactrols, or JFETs, his design is based around using the CD4007’s matched CMOS FETs to form the state-variable filter. We’ve taken Dylan159’s clever design work and packaged it up into a 125B.

## Before you get started...

No direct support is offered for issues faced when building this project. This project works as designed, but this project is not for first-time builders. There are plenty of projects that are better suited for beginners, this is not one of them.

This project uses stacked circuit boards in a 125B enclosure with top I/O jacks. Some special parts are required, including low-profile electrolytic capacitors, special fasteners, and inline pin headers/sockets. Special care must be taken when handling the CD4007 IC as well because these ICs are notoriously sensitive to static electricity.

## Tayda Drill Tool Template...

We've also put together a drill template for this project using Tayda Electronics' enclosure drill tool.
