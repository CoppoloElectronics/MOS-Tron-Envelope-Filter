# MOS-Tron Envelope Filter

Based on the Chewborg Envelope Filter by Dylan159 at freestomboxes.org. According to Dylan159, the Chewborg is designed around the familiar sounds of the most popular envelope filters of all time, but instead of being designed with LDRs, Vactrols, or JFETs, his design is based around using the CD4007’s matched CMOS FETs to form the state-variable filter. We’ve taken Dylan159’s clever design work and packaged it up into a 125B.
